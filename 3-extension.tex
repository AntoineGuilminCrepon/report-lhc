\section{Description of the extension}

The main point of the extension is to add an object to the language complementary to the $\mathbf{wp}_{\forall}$ from the original model.

This object is defined as such :

$\WPE{\m{t}}{Q} ::= \lambda s. \E s' v. \bigstep t s v {s'} \land Q(v)$

This object behaves in the same way as $\mathbf{wp}_{\forall}$ for most of the rules previously described. Those rules are written down for completeness.
