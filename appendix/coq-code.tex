\section{Coq implementation}
\label{sec:coq-code}

The implementation as is, is separated in three different files. \code{structures.v} describes the different types needed for the logic.

\inputminted[breaklines]{Coq}{code/structures.v}

\code{notation.v} defines the notations for hyper-assertions, useful definitions to manage the soundess proofs.

\inputminted[breaklines]{Coq}{code/notation.v}

\code{prelude.v} contains the soundness proofs of the different rule of the logic. A portion of the rules are left as axioms, by lack of time to prove them all. A more comprehensive formalisation is under way at time of writing.
