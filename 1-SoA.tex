Hoare logic was one of the first attempt at creating a formal framework for proving statements on programs. However, it proved itself limited for proving certain properties. In particular, dealing with non-determinism can become tricky, since basic Hoare logic can only deal with a given execution at a time. More generally, hyperproperties are an issue for basic Hoare logic, as they require to reason on multiple executions of the same program, or the execution of different programs.

Thus, multiple frameworks have been designed over the years to deal with those hyperproperties, mainly by extending Hoare logic to directly work on so-called hyperterms, i.e finite sets of terms, instead of regular terms.

LHC (for Logic for Hypertriple Composition) is one of those frameworks,
